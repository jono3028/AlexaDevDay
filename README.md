### Alexa Skill: Alive or Dead

## Intro:

This skill was created during the Alexa Dev Day held at Amazon HQ on July 19, 2017. A fact based skill provides a response based upon a user query. This skill parses data from the website www.deadoraliveinfo.com and returns whether a celebrity is alive or dead along with additional information like their age, or a breif bio. The website deadoraliveinfo does not offer an API, data was scraped following the generation of a URL from the user defined input.
